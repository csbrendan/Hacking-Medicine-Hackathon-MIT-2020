# Hacking-Medicine-Hackathon-MIT-2020

## Overview
This repository contains the project documentation for a proof of concept (POC) conversational AI developed for cancer patients during the [Hacking Medicine Hackathon at MIT](https://grandhack.mit.edu/) in 2020.

## Project Description
**Team_a_016 - Carey**
We developed a Conversational AI assistant named "Carey" aimed at empowering and informing cancer patients, while also standardizing the reporting of patient preferences and experiences to healthcare providers (HCP).

### Features

- Tracks compliance with treatment, mood, sleep, appetite, pain, nausea, and other symptoms.
- Facilitates communication with physicians through reports and analytics.

### Potential Impact
- Targets 500,000 potential users in the US.
- Enhances adherence to treatment and patient satisfaction.
- Improves healthcare outcomes including reduced ICU admissions and increased enrollment in palliative care.

### Team Members
- **Lucas Lima**: Medical Physics and Artificial Intelligence
- **Agustina Saenz**: Physician
- **Brendan Murphy**: Software Developer and Artificial Intelligence
- **Esther Freire**: Medicine
